#  Requirement Analysis in Software Development

This repository serves as a comprehensive resource and a practical project for mastering the principles and methodologies of Requirement Analysis in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). Through a series of structured tasks, it aims to provide a detailed blueprint for defining, documenting, analyzing, and structuring software requirements, simulating real-world development scenarios for effective project execution.


##  What is Requirement Analysis?

**Requirement Analysis** is a vital phase in the **Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)** where the goals, expectations, and needs of stakeholders are identified, gathered, analyzed, and documented. It serves as the foundation for building a software system that fulfills the intended purpose.

During this process, business analysts, developers, designers, and stakeholders collaborate to clearly define what the software must do and the constraints it must operate under. This helps ensure alignment between the development team and the end-users.
